 <li><strong>[20 Points]</strong> Given input {4371, 1323, 6173, 4199, 4344, 9679, 1989} and a hash function h(x) = x mod 10, show the resulting:

  <ol>

   <li>Separate Chaining hash table</li>

   <li>Hash Table using linear probing</li>

   <li>Hash table using quadratic probing</li>

   <li>Hash table with second hash function h<sub>2</sub>(x) = 7 â€“ ( x mod 7)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li><strong>[10 Points]</strong> A min-max heap is a data Structure that supports both deleteMin and deleteMax in O(logN) per operation. The structure is identical to a binary heap, but the heap-order property is that for any node, X, at even depth, the element stored at X is smaller than the parent but larger than the grandparent ( where this makes sense), and for any node X at odd depth, the element stored at X is larger than the parent but smaller than grandparent. See Fig.</li>

 <li>How do we find the minimum and maximum element?</li>

 <li>Give an algorithm to insert a new node into the min-max heap.</li>

 <li><strong>[10 Points]</strong> Give an algorithm to find all nodes less than some value X, in a binary heap. Your algorithm should run in O(K), where K is number of nodes output.</li>
